# Python Generators for Large Dataset Processing

Handle massive datasets without breaking your memory. This project teaches you to use Python generators for efficient data processing and real-world streaming scenarios.

## What You'll Build

- Memory-efficient data processors using `yield`
- Batch processing systems for huge datasets
- Live data streaming simulations
- SQL-integrated data pipelines

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic SQL (MySQL/SQLite)
- Git basics

## Why This Matters

Loading a 10GB dataset into memory? Your system will crash. Generators let you process data one piece at a time, keeping memory usage flat no matter how big your data gets.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd python-generators-project
pip install mysql-connector-python python-dotenv
```

Set up your database, then run the examples to see generators crush large datasets with minimal resources.

## Perfect For

Data engineers, backend devs, or anyone tired of "out of memory" errors when processing real-world data.
